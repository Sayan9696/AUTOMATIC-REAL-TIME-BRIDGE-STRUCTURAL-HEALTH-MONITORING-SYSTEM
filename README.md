# AUTOMATIC REAL-TIME BRIDGE STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING SYSTEM
Automatic Real-Time Bridge Structural Health Monitoring System is significant to health diagnosis of bridges and flyovers. This report is proposed and developed a novel architecture for large span bridge monitoring. A 3-level distributed structure is adopted in the monitoring system, which includes Central server, Intelligent Acquisition nodes and Local controller. Acquisition Nodes or The Sensors are located across the bridge. All the acquisition nodes are managed by one local controller. Every acquisition node samples different parameters of the bridge. Signals of various sensors are analysed & then processing results are sent to the local controller through wireless networks. IoT is utilized to provide enough bandwidth for real time data transmission between local controller & the central server. The sensors monitor cracks, bend, water level, sustainability, no. of vehicles moving over the bridge etc. At any time if any of these parameters cross their threshold value the system giving an alarm by sending the location for taking precautionary measures. This technology can be called Monitoring based maintenance that enables the highway bridge maintenance authorities monitor the condition of it in real time. We also want to add another feature which is if any vehicle breaks the load capacity & speed rule of the bridge then the system will capture the image of that vehicle & from that the vehicle number as well as the information about the owner of the vehicle can be extracted.

## Objective of The Project

* Design of Automatic Real-time Bridge Structural Health Monitoring System.
* Provide 24*7 Camera Surveillance
* Monitor the Water level, Temperature & Humidity of the bridge.
* Monitor the loads on the bridge, Bending & the Vibrations of the bridge.
* Count the no. of vehicles moving over the bridge.
* Transmit these above-mentioned parameters to the Control Station using Wireless Network.
* Display the parameters in the Control Station using any visual interface & analyse the parameters for real-time monitoring.
* Capture the image of the vehicle which breaks the weight & speed laws.
* At any point of time if any of these parameters cross their threshold value the system will alarm the Control Station for taking any precautionary measures.
* Extract the vehicle number plate from the image & identify the owner of that vehicle from that vehicle number to take actions against him/her.
* Construct simple & cost-effective design of the system.
